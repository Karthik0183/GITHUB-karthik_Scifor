        <p class="p">Beneath the surface of the ocean 
    lies a world more mysterious than the farthest reaches of space. Teeming with life, color, and constant motion, the deep sea is a place of both beauty and danger. Strange creatures with bioluminescent bodies drift through the darkness, illuminating the water like stars in a midnight sky. Volcanic vents bubble with superheated water,
     creating entire ecosystems where no sunlight reaches. Despite covering over 70% of Earth's surface, the ocean remains largely unexplored, reminding us how much of our own planet still holds secrets waiting to be uncovered.</p>
