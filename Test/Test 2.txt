1. What is CSS and why do we use it in web development?
A. CSS is cascading style sheets it is used for styling the HTML document and giving it a visual appeal 
   It helps us separate the HTML and Styling so that the code looks clean and we can change things easily
   It can change the fonts,colors,alignement,backgrounds etc.

2. Explain the difference between inline, internal, and external CSS with examples.
A. The difference of inline,internal and external CSS is in the way it is implemented in the HTML document.
   In inline css the styling is applied right in the line we want to effect, for eg: <p style="color:red">The text needs to be red here</p>
   and the css only effects in that line leaving other p tags without red 
   In internal css it effects the entire HTML document and it is implemented inside the head tag with the style tag
   for eg:
   <head>
   <style>
   h1{color:blue;
    font-size:22px;}
   </style>
   </head>
   here every h1 element in the document will have the styles applied to it
  In external css the styling is implemented in a different .css file and is linked in the head using link tag it helps keep both separate and
  is helpful for large projects, for eg:
  <head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
  </head>

3. Define the CSS box model and describe its components.
A. The css box model is used to create visual boxes in the html,the different components of this models are
   a)padding:this creates the space between the content and border
   b)content:the text,image,video displayed in the box
   c)border:the visual separation of the content from the rest of the html contents
   d)margin:the space between the page and border
   for eg:
   div{
   width:150px;
   border:10px solid black;
   padding:15px;
   margin:20px;
   }

4. What is the difference between id and class selectors in CSS?
A. the id selector is used for styling specific elements in the HTML
   for eg:
   #test{
   font-size:22px;
   color:lightgrey;
   }

   <p id="test">This is an id selector</p>
   the class elements is used for styling all elements with the class attributes
   for eg:
   .test1{
    color:green;
    background-color:blue;
    }

   <p class="test1">This is a class selector</p>
